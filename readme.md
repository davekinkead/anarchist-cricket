# Can anarchists play cricket?

This is an initial outline for an argument about political authority, obligation, and consent.  As an initial rough outline, it is not yet ready to be forked.  Work-in-progress can be viewed on the `draft` branch.

### Abstract

Anarchism is a political theory typically thought to reject political obligations and complex organisational systems. A game of cricket is a competitive endeavour requiring the acceptance of a central authority.   I argue that if anarchists can play cricket, then they can accept complex forms of political organisation involving centralised authority and power structures. 

### Outline

- Current literature on anarchism
  - rejects political authority
  - rejects centralisation of power
  - not associated with complex political systems
- Examine cricket
  - evolution of rules
  - authority of umpire
  - obligations of players
- Join the two
  - if an anarchist can play cricket, they can accept political obligations of a central power
  - anarchists can play cricket
  - therefore anarchists can accept political obligations of a central power
