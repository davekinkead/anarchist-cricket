# Can Anarchists Play Cricket?

### Abstract

Anarchism is a political theory typically thought to reject political obligations and complex organisational systems. A game of cricket is a competitive endeavour requiring the acceptance of a central authority.   I argue that if anarchists can play cricket, then they can accept complex forms of political organisation involving centralised authority and power structures.
